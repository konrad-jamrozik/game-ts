## Use the local Vitest documentation for any Vitest/testing questions --

- 1. When asked about Vitest, testing, or test setup, always check for docs/about_vitest.md and use its content to answer.
- 2. If the answer is not found in the doc, supplement with best practices or official Vitest docs, but always reference the local doc first.
- 3. When providing code samples or setup instructions, prefer approaches described in docs/about_vitest.md.
- 4. If the doc is missing, inform the user and offer to help create it.
