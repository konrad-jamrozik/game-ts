# Clearing VS Code cache

First, close all VS Code instances.

``` powershell
cd "$env:AppData\Code"
rm -Recurse -Force .\Cache\
rm -Recurse -Force .\CachedData\
```

# Tips & tricks

- VS Code treats some JSON files as JSON with comments (`jsonc`) via the `files.associations` setting:

# Troubleshooting

## Markdown `Open Preview to the Side` fails with `Error loading webview:`

If the command `Markdown: Open Preview to the Side` from the `bierner.markdown-preview-github-styles` extension
fails with the following error:

``` text
Error loading webview: Error: Could not register service worker: InvalidStateError: Failed to register a ServiceWorker: The document is in an invalid state.
```

then clear VS Code cache [as described in docs/about_vscode.md](about_vscode.md#clearing-vs-code-cache).

## Markdown "Open Preview to the Side" is formatted badly

Ensure these extensions are not installed and restart VS Code:

``` text
docsmsft.docs-markdown
docsmsft.docs-preview
```
