# About game progress

This document explains the progress a player must make to win the game.

Principally the progress is done by investigating leads to spawn mission sites.
These mission sites, when completed successfully, lead to more leads, which lead to more mission sites, etc.

For each enemy faction there is a final mission site that when completed successfully, destroys the faction.

The game is won when all enemy factions are destroyed.
