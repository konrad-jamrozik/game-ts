# How the repository was set up

# Basic setup

1. Installed VS Code on my local OS.
2. Created the repository via GitHub web UI.
3. Cloned the repository locally.
4. Added the basics:
    ```text
    LICENSE
    .vscode/extensions.json
    .vscode/settings.json
    docs/about_vscode.md
    docs/repo_setup.md
    .markdownlint.json
    README.md
    .gitignore
    ```

## License setup

Added `LICENSE` file to have http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/.
I chose it by analyzing existing licenses, originally inspired by XCF license,
which is the same.

Then I had to ensure markdownlint is not reporting issues with it -
refer to doc on markdownlint to see how I did it.

## README setup

Added `README.md` with the usual information.

## Markdown files in docs folder

I wrote various documentation files in the `docs` folder when setting up the repository for the first time.

Most notably, ran `Markdown All in One: Create Table of Contents` action to generate table of contents.
This command comes from the `Markdown All in One` extension, which is recommended in the `.vscode/extensions.json` file.
