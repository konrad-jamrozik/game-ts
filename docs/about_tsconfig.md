# About tsconfig.json

Per [tsconfig doc], a TSConfig file in a directory indicates that the directory is the root
of a TypeScript or JavaScript project.

# Initial tsconfig.*.json files setup

The `tsconfig*.json` files in the `web` project were initially generated with a Vite template
(see [about-vite.md](about_vite.md)), and then adjusted by me to fit the needs of the project.

This configuration is based on the vite-react-ts template [create-vite react-ts]

- Include settings from the vite-react and strictest [tsconfig bases] specifically [vite-react] and [strictest].
- Make root dedup configs code and have newest EST target.
