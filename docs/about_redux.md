# About Redux and Redux Toolkit (RTK)

# Initial Redux Toolkit setup

## Setup package

From https://redux-toolkit.js.org/tutorials/quick-start

```powershell
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```

## Setup eslint

There is no plugin for eslint to configure. Notably, I did not use
https://github.com/DianaSuvorova/eslint-plugin-react-redux#readme

as it appears to be outdated:

- It has rules for `connect` which are [pre-hooks][connect].
- The README only mentions legacy eslint config, not flat config.

## Setup Redux devtools

Install in Chrome, per:
https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools/tree/main/extension#installation

Then use it in Dev tools. That's it!

## Setup TypeScript, testing best practices

ðŸš§KJA WIP Next, set it up to work with TypeScript per:

- https://redux-toolkit.js.org/tutorials/typescript

- https://redux.js.org/usage/#code-quality
  - https://redux.js.org/usage/writing-tests
    - Note: the Redux DevTools Chrome extensions has a feature to generate tests snippet from current state.
  - https://redux.js.org/usage/usage-with-typescript
    - Notably eslint setup: https://redux.js.org/usage/usage-with-typescript#use-typed-hooks-in-components

# Caveats

## Randomness goes into action creators, not reducers. Use `prepare` callback

- https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-4-using-data#preparing-action-payloads
- https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createSlice#customizing-generated-action-creators
- https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createAction#using-prepare-callbacks-to-customize-action-contents

## Using selectors effectively

# Performance

- https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-6-performance-normalization#improving-render-performance

## Double dispatch and avoiding rerenders

In React 18+ calling `dispatch` multiple times in a row will still result in one render,
per this note:
https://react-redux.js.org/api/batch

- Cannot call dispatch from reducer:

# Research

Probably want to use Redux Toolkit (RTK), instead of React simple useReducer.
